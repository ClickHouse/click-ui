# Click UI

[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-blue.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org)

Click UI is the ClickHouse design system and component library. Our aim with Click UI is to provide an accessible, theme-able, modern, and attractive interface with which to experience the speed and power of ClickHouse.

You can find the official docs for the Click UI design system and component library at [clickhouse.design/click-ui](https://clickhouse.design/click-ui).

## Overview

* [Requirements](#requirements)
* [Development](#development)
  - [Generating design tokens](#generating-design-tokens)
  - [Local development server](#local-development-server)
* [Tests](#Tests)
* [Storybook](#storybook)
  - [Stories development server](#stories-development-server)
  - [Public static site](#public-static-site)
* [Releases and Versions](#releases-and-versions)

## Requirements

- Nodejs (>= 22.12.x) as runtime
- Yarn (>= 4.5.3) for development, any other package manager in a host project

## Development

The project uses yarn package manager for development.

After cloning the repository change to the work directory and install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

### Generating design tokens

Tokens are provided by a style directionary sourced from [tokens-studio](https://tokens.studio/).

It's expected to have theme tokens provided externally, e.g. Figma tokens-studio output is stored in the repository and a PR's opened. The assets are stored in the directory [./tokens/themes].

Once [./tokens/themes] files are updated, we must regenerate the tokens:

```sh
yarn generate-tokens
```

Learn more about tokens-studio [here](https://documentation.tokens.studio/).

### Local development server

To run the Click UI development execute the command:

```sh
yarn dev
```

It'll default to the location [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173), if port available.

## Tests

The package uses [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [react testing library](https://testing-library.com) for tests, e.g. functional tests.

```sh
yarn test
```

## Storybook

The component library provides a collection of ready-to-use components. We use [Storybook](#storybook) to showcase and document our components.

### Stories development server

Start the storybook development server:

```sh
yarn storybook
```

It'll default to the location [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006), if port available.

### Build static site

To build a static version:

```sh
yarn storybook:build
```

Once built, you can serve the static files by:

```sh
yarn storybook:serve
```

### Public static version

The latest static version's built and deployed automatically when contributing to `main` of [Click UI](https://github.com/ClickHouse/click-ui).

Once deployed it's available publicly at [clickhouse.design/click-ui](https://clickhouse.design/click-ui).

## Using Click UI in an external app

Click UI has been tested in NextJS, Gatsby, and Vite. If you run into problems using it in your app, please create an issue and our team will try to answer.

1. Navigate to your app's route and run
   `npm i @clickhouse/click-ui`
   or
   `yarn add @clickhouse/click-ui`
2. Make sure to wrap your application in the Click UI `ClickUIProvider`, without doing this, you may run into issues with styled-components. Once that's done, you'll be able to import the individual components that you want to use on each page. Here's an example of an `App.tsx` in NextJS.

```typescript
import { ClickUIProvider, Text, ThemeName, Title, Switch } from '@clickhouse/click-ui'
import { useState } from 'react'

function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<ThemeName>('dark')

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    theme === 'dark' ? setTheme('light') : setTheme('dark')
  }

  return (
    <ClickUIProvider theme={theme} config={{tooltip:{ delayDuration: 0 }}}>
      <Switch 
        checked={theme === 'dark'} 
        onCheckedChange={() => toggleTheme()} 
        label="Dark mode"
      />

      <Title type='h1'>Click UI Example</Title>
      <Text>Welcome to Click UI. Get started here.</Text>
    </ClickUIProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Releases and Versions

New versions and release notes are available at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ClickHouse/click-ui/releases).

To create a new release and publish a new version, follow the instructions in [publish.md](./docs/publish.md).

## Conventional commits

We prefer to commit our work following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) conventions. Conventional Commits are a simple way to write commit messages that both people and computers can understand. It help us keep track fo changes in a consistent manner, making it easier to see what was added, changed, or fixed in each commit or update.

The commit messages are formatted as **[type]/[scope]**
The **type** is a short descriptor indicating the nature of the work (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore). This follows the conventional commit types.

The **scope** is a more detailed description of the feature or fix. This could be the component or part of the codebase affected by the change.

Here's an example of different conventional commits messages that you must follow:

```txt
test: 💍 Adding missing tests
feat: 🎸 A new feature
fix: 🐛 A bug fix
chore: 🤖 Build process or auxiliary tool changes
docs: 📝 Documentation only changes
refactor: 💡 A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
style: 💄 Markup, white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons...
```
