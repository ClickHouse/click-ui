# Click UI

The home of the ClickHouse design system and component library. Click UI is in very early development and subject to change, we do not recommend using it for production purposes.

### Using Click UI in an external app

Click UI has been tested in NextJS, Gatsby, and Vite. If you run into problems using it in your app, please create an issue and our team will try to answer.
1. Navigate to your app's route and run
   `npm i @clickhouse/click-ui`
   or
   `yarn add @clickhouse/click-ui`
2. Make sure to wrap your application in the Click UI `ClickUIProvider`, without doing this, you may run into issues with styled-components. Once thats done, you'll be able to import the individual components that you want to use on each page. Here's an example an `App.tsx` in NextJS.

```ts
import { ClickUIProvider, Text, ThemeName, Title, Switch } from '@clickhouse/click-ui'

function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<ThemeName>('dark')

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    theme === 'dark' ? setTheme('light') : setTheme('dark')
  }

  return (
    <ClickUIProvider theme={theme} config={{tooltip:{ delayDuration: 0 }}}>
      <Switch checked={theme === 'dark'} onClick={() => toggleTheme() } />

      <Title type='h1'>Click UI Example</Title>
      <Text>Welcome to Click UI. Get started here.</Text>
    </ClickUIProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```
