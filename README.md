# Click UI

You can find the official docs for the Click UI design system and component library at [clickhouse.design/click-ui](https://clickhouse.design/click-ui).

## Using Click UI in an external app

Click UI has been tested in NextJS, Gatsby, and Vite. If you run into problems using it in your app, please create an issue and our team will try to answer.

1. Navigate to your app's route and run
   `npm i @clickhouse/click-ui`
   or
   `yarn add @clickhouse/click-ui`
2. Make sure to wrap your application in the Click UI `ClickUIProvider`, without doing this, you may run into issues with styled-components. Once that's done, you'll be able to import the individual components that you want to use on each page. Here's an example of an `App.tsx` in NextJS.

```typescript
import { ClickUIProvider, Text, ThemeName, Title, Switch } from '@clickhouse/click-ui'
import { useState } from 'react'

function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<ThemeName>('dark')

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    theme === 'dark' ? setTheme('light') : setTheme('dark')
  }

  return (
    <ClickUIProvider theme={theme} config={{tooltip:{ delayDuration: 0 }}}>
      <Switch 
        checked={theme === 'dark'} 
        onCheckedChange={() => toggleTheme()} 
        label="Dark mode"
      />

      <Title type='h1'>Click UI Example</Title>
      <Text>Welcome to Click UI. Get started here.</Text>
    </ClickUIProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Releases and Versions

New versions and release notes are available at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ClickHouse/click-ui/releases).

To create a new release and publish a new version, follow the instructions in [publish.md](./docs/publish.md).

## Conventional commits

We prefer to commit our work following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) conventions. Conventional Commits are a simple way to write commit messages that both people and computers can understand. It help us keep track fo changes in a consistent manner, making it easier to see what was added, changed, or fixed in each commit or update.

The commit messages are formatted as **[type]/[scope]**
The **type** is a short descriptor indicating the nature of the work (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore). This follows the conventional commit types.

The **scope** is a more detailed description of the feature or fix. This could be the component or part of the codebase affected by the change.

Here's an example of different conventional commits messages that you must follow:

```txt
test: 💍 Adding missing tests
feat: 🎸 A new feature
fix: 🐛 A bug fix
chore: 🤖 Build process or auxiliary tool changes
docs: 📝 Documentation only changes
refactor: 💡 A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
style: 💄 Markup, white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons...
```
