# Click UI component reference
Click UI is the ClickHouse design system and component library. Our aim with Click UI is to provide an accessible, theme-able, modern, and attractive interface with which to experience the speed and power of ClickHouse.
<br /><br />This site is a reference for inspecting components and their props. Official documentation lives at [clickhouse.design/click-ui](https://clickhouse.design/click-ui).
<br /><br />The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ClickHouse/click-ui) and the latest version of the package can be on [npm.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clickhouse/click-ui). Once ready, we’ll be publishing the design system to the Figma community.

### Using Click UI in an external app
Click UI has been tested in NextJS, Gatsby, and Vite. If you run into problems using it in your app, please create an issue and our team will try to answer.

1. **Install Click UI**
   ```bash
   npm install @clickhouse/click-ui
   ```

2. **Import the styles**

   Add this import at the top of your main application file (before other styles):

   ```typescript
   import '@clickhouse/click-ui/style.css';
   ```

3. **Wrap your app with ClickUIProvider**

   ```typescript
   import '@clickhouse/click-ui/style.css';
   import { ClickUIProvider, Text, Title } from '@clickhouse/click-ui'

   function App() {
     return (
       <ClickUIProvider theme="system">
         <Title type='h1'>Click UI Example</Title>
         <Text>Welcome to Click UI!</Text>
       </ClickUIProvider>
     )
   }

   export default App
   ```
