This library will now use CSS Modules for styling and is distributed unbundled, giving your application full control over bundling and optimisations. This means you only include what you actually use, resulting in smaller bundle sizes and better performance!

NOTE: We're currently migrating from Styled-Components to CSS Modules. Some components may still use Styled-Components during this transition period.

To learn more about CSS modules support, check our documentation [here](https://github.com/ClickHouse/click-ui?tab=readme-ov-file#css-modules)
